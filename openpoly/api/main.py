"""FastAPI app: section catalog endpoint, news-source and market-source routes.

Catalog is scanned once at app startup and cached in-process. To pick up new
impls, restart the backend (per v2 plan: full rescan, never incremental).

Lifespan handles graceful shutdown of the NewsSourceManager singleton so a
running WS task is cancelled cleanly on SIGINT (per v4 plan risk 1). It also
auto-starts the news + market sources so a fresh process (every uvicorn
--reload included) comes up already streaming — opt out with
``OPENPOLY_AUTOSTART_SOURCES=0`` (tests do this).
