"""Synchronous transactional store over the fill ledger + position table.

The portfolio is state that must never be lost — unlike the write-behind
``order_book`` / ``news`` sinks, every call here commits synchronously inside
one transaction. openPoly is one-shot per (market, side): a position is exactly
one buy fill, later one sell fill; ``open_position`` / ``close_position`` write
the fill and the position-projection row together.

The store is stateless — it holds only a session factory and touches the DB
only when a method is called, so it is safe to construct before ``init_db``.
