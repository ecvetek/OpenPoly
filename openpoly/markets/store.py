"""In-memory market catalog.

``MarketStore`` holds the current discovered + filtered market universe plus a
summary of the most recent discovery poll. Single-writer (the market-source
polling task) / multi-reader (HTTP status route, sections). ``replace`` rebinds
the whole catalog dict in one assignment, so a reader always sees a complete
snapshot — no lock needed under FastAPI's single event loop.

The catalog and latest order books are in-memory reference data, rebuilt by the
next poll / sample after a restart. Persisting the order book depth ladder as a
time series is a separate concern (memory ``openpoly_market_data_persistence``).
