"""Discovery-time market filtering.

Takes normalized ``Market`` objects (the raw Polymarket universe) and selects
the tradeable candidate set that feeds the analyzer. This is *discovery*
filtering — "is this market a valid candidate at all" — **not** the per-trade
entry gate (that runs later, on the single matched market, with fresh data).

Filter logic mirrors a prior project's ``sync_markets`` + the v8 trading spec:

  - §0.1 fee ceiling — ``taker_fee_rate <= max_fee`` (fail-closed on ``None``)
  - §6 Gate 2 liveness / Gate 4 expiry / Gate 5 market quality

Each market is either kept or rejected with a single stable reason label.
Rules are ordered structural-and-permanent first, quality last — so a market
that fails several rules reports the most fundamental cause.
