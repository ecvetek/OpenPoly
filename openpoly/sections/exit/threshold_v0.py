"""Threshold exit baseline — take-profit / stop-loss / peak-drawdown.

Atomized from a prior project v8 §10: Rule 6 (take_profit), Rule 2 (max_loss) and a
*lightweight* Rule 3 (peak_drawdown). openPoly tracks ``peak_price`` as a
scalar but deliberately drops ``peak_exit_cost`` (the cost-adjusted form) and
the heavier trailing-stop / LLM-consult variants. This keeps the public baseline
deterministic, auditable, and cheap to run.

The section is a pure function of its input ``MarkedPosition``: the runtime
injects the held side's current price *and* its tracked peak price into the
position before each call. Peak tracking itself lives in ``ExitMonitor`` —
the section never holds state across ticks.

Trigger precedence is ``stop_loss → peak_drawdown → take_profit`` (a prior project's
v6 ordering): the absolute-loss circuit fires first, then the trailing lock
on banked gains, with the absolute take-profit ceiling as the final fallback.
