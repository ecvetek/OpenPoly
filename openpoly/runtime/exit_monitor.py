"""Exit monitor — the position-driven, timer-driven close loop.

The news pipeline (orchestrator) is event-driven; closing a position is
position-driven + periodic. ``ExitMonitor`` runs a tick loop: every
``tick_interval_seconds`` it walks every open position, marks it with the held
side's current price (level-1 bid of the held token's order book), runs the
``exit`` section, and — when the section returns a ``CloseIntent`` — routes it
to ``executor.execute_sell``. Each evaluation is recorded in ``exit_log``.

It shares the one module-level ``executor`` with the orchestrator — entry buys
and exit sells go through the same fill path. The ``PortfolioStore`` is
injected by the FastAPI lifespan once the DB is up.

A position whose market has resolved drops out of the catalog → no order book →
the monitor logs a ``skip`` and leaves the position open. Settlement-close is a
separate concern, out of scope.

The tick does only sync work (DB read/write, in-memory book lookup, the pure
exit section) — all sub-millisecond — so it runs inline; the loop yields
cooperatively between ticks (docs/architecture/05).
