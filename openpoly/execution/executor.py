"""Execution — the level-1 paper fill service.

A fixed system service (not a pluggable section): it turns an entry
``OrderIntent`` or an exit close decision into an actual fill, recorded through
``PortfolioStore``. The fill model is deliberately crude — it takes the order
book's level-1 price (BUY at the best ask, SELL at the best bid) and caps a buy
by that level's depth. No walk-book, no slippage model, no fees (zero-fee
rule). At micro-stakes ($5-$50) an order rarely walks past level 1, so this is
not worth more.

Entry and exit share this one executor so their accounting is symmetric. It
reads the live ``MarketStore`` singleton directly (same pattern as the
embedding section — no capability injection). Construction touches no DB; the
``PortfolioStore`` is injected by the FastAPI lifespan once the database is up.
